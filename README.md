# Machine Learning Algorithms: Clustering

Machine learning is all about learning structure in data, this code illustrates “Unsupervised clustering” which is a method for interpreting the structure of a dataset.
Clustering is a machine learning algorithm the code uses “k-means” clustering algorithm where “k” in “k-means” stands for the number of clusters you wish to find.
